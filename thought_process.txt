I've done some Googling, and found various solutions online. 
So I took the necessary steps in order to resolve the issue. Here is my thought process:

Some of the tutorials on solving the issue mentioned the use of "BFS". Upon further research, I discovered
that BFS (Breadth-First Search) is an algorithm that starts its search at a source, moves to neighbouring
nodes that are connected to the source (should conditions be met), then moves on to the next level or layer
before continuing the search. 

This entails making use of a queue to store the moves in. I've imported and made use of the Collections library
to ease handling of the array (.popleft(), .deque(), etc.)

The rest was trial and error, standard logic and solving issues via Google.
