# minimum-knight-moves-test
Interview test (nr.2): You want to figure out an algorithm for how many moves a knight (L shaped movement) in chessboard (8x8) will have to move to get from one point (srcX,srcY) to endpoint (destX,destY).  In language of choice (preferably python for this) write a function that takes the input (srcX,srcY) and (destX,destY) and outputs the minimum number of moves
